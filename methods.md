# Methodology
## Data Sources
- data set donwnloaded from GitHub
- includes statistics on 52 U.S. states
## Data Preparation/Cleaning
- data set loaded into frame
- mostly clean initially
- heading names were changed
- all lowerscase letters
- no spaces between words
## Assumptions
- data taken from 2021/2022
- values from the set are from a specific year and all are recorded from the same year
- stats for car insurance premiums are an average from each state
- losses incurred by insurance companies are an average from each state
- every driver in each state is accounted for
## Limitations
- exact time frame of when data was recorded is unknown
- if values were not consistently taken from the same tiime frame, this could affect the accuracy of comparisions drawn between states
- if data set is too old, information may not be relevant anymore and could lead to false conclusions
- if money values are an overall average taken from an entire state, a broad range of cities and counties are included which could lead to incorrect interpreations about individual states.
- the method of how the amount of drivers are counted in each state isn't specified, so it's not definitive if all drivers were accounted for in each state
